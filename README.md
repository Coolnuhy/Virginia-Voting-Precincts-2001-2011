these are Shapefiles for Virginia for the years 2001-2011. With the exception of 2002, they are able to be completly matched with election data from the Department of Elections. Several sources were used to construct these, a vtd was constructed using Census 2007. Other files, for 2005-3006 were obtained from J. Miles Coleman and @anders; X user @ciync donated 2008/2009 shapefiles. For 2001-2004,2007 I drew the lines matching the other files with the data, using the VTD. 2011 was built using 2010 vtd and a 2012 shapefile found on the Virginia Voting Precicnts Github
